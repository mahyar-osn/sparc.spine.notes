# Spinal Column and Vertebrae

The adult vertebral column consitists of 26 bones:
	
- vertebrae (24)
- sacrum
- coccyx
	
There are five regions: 

- cervical (C1-C7)
- thoracic (T1-T12)
- lumbar (L1-L5)
- sacral
- coccygeal
	
Each region has different anatomival specializations to allow for differential functions. The total length of the vertebral column of an adult averages about 71 cm (28 in.).

#
### Spinal curves
#
 The spinal column does not form a straight structure. There are four **spinal curves**: 
 
 1) cervical curve
 2) thoracic curve
 3) lumbar curve
 4) sacral curve

### Vertebral Anatomy
#
Generally, vertebrae seem to have a common structural plan - see figure below. Anteriorly, each vertebra has a relatively thick, spherical to oval *body*, from which a *vertebral arch* extends posteriorly. Various processes either for muscle attachement or for rib rticulation extend from the vertebral arch. Paird *articular processes* on both the superior and inferior surfaces project from the vertebral arch. These points represent the articulation between adjacent vertebrae.
